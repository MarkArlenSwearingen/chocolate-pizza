Chocolate Pizza Lab 10 

Today went super well. I drove and Mark overviewed and together we made an awesome team! We spent about 4 hours on this assignment and while our code is probably not the prettiest, we got through with what we could complete. We had some difficulties with the button. I have not found a way in the past 4 hours to style the button to look like it on the website, but other than this, I think we have made pretty much everything else very close to their site.
